This mod is a forked version of [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric). Since it is a forked version, it **cannot be used with the original version**.
This is a replacement program, not an add-on.

The mod may be archived after the issue with [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) itself is fixed, but for now,
this is the only solution for 1.20.1 with [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) using [Hephaestus](https://modrinth.com/mod/hephaestus) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) 0.5.x.

**Mods developed based on the original mod will also be unavailable (this has to do with the version of `PortingLib`)**.

### This fork fixes the following issues
- Fixed a crash that occurred when installing with [Hephaestus](https://modrinth.com/mod/hephaestus). **(This was due to a problem with the version of `PortingLib` used by Create Fabric.)**
- Fixed compatibility with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) 0.5.x **(this issue was caused by Flywheel Fabric)**.

### Development to compatible
See [issue#4](https://github.com/DM-Earth/create-fabric-dme-edition/issues/4)
